# Code_Wars-Hacker_Rank
## My Journey after BootCamp

After finishing my local Coding Bootcamp down here in Phoenix, AZ, I found myself with a feeling of hoplessness, and what I would argue is worse, a feeling of diminishing skill. I, like my fellow newly hatched devlopers, are eager for professional work, yet hit the hard reality of being set free to the open market.

Here I hope to share a record of maintenance and improvement in my Coding skills, and possibly inspire and help others who share the feeling of being upcreek without a paddle.

## Resouces
I will be using Hanker Rank and Code Wars to keep my skills sharp and ready for employment. Why do chhose these two sites? Because they are fun and you get points, badges, and instant gratification!

Also, they are very well structured and easily avaiable for everyone out there to use.
